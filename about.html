            <h3>Designed in the studio</h3>
            <p>From the initial concept to final sampling, our design process takes place inside our Auckland studio which doubles as our retail space. This way of working allows every person who steps through our door to connect with the people behind the brand and gain insight into what goes into making each piece.

        </div>

       
        <div class="abouttext">
 
                <p>Moon Choi is a New York based fashion designer and a recent BFA graduate from Parsons School of Design. With an affinity for exceptional tailoring and a specialization in wearable accessories, Moon explores a fine balance between weighted masculine cuts and feminine subtleties. Her unusual silhouettes are designed to be layered, or worn alone. Moon's singular pieces are the expressive result of how she believes clothing can influence one's identity and behaviour.</p>
                
                <p>Influenced by her origins, she considers tailoring central to her designs. Moon says, 'My background defines who I am as a designer and influences my process'.</p>
                
                <p>Previously, Moon has worked with 3.1 Phillip Lim and upon graduating, was announced winner of '­Portfolio of The Year' and finalist of 'Designer of the Year in ­Womenswear'. Moon was selected to receive the LF USA Scholarship and sponsorships from Jason Wu Fabric, 3.1 Phillip Lim Leather and The Shoe Polytechnic (Politecnico Calzaturiero). She was also selected as a semi-finalist for the Vfiles Academy Prize and the CFDA Liz Claiborne Design Scholarship Award. Lastly, she was selected as a finalist of CFDA + 2016 Design Graduates.
